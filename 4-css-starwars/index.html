    <p class="farGalaxy">It is a period of civil war.
        Rebel spaceships, striking
        from a hidden base, have won
        their first victory against
        the evil Galactic Empire.

        During the battle, Rebel
        spies managed to steal secret
        plans to the Empire's
        ultimate weapon, the DEATH
        STAR, an armored space
        station with enough power
        to destroy an entire planet.

        Pursued by the Empire's
        sinister agents, Princess
        Leia races home aboard her
        starship, custodian of the
        stolen plans that can save her
        people and restore
        freedom to the galaxy....
        Return of the Jedi
        episode: 6
        release_date: 1983-05-25
        opening crawl: Luke Skywalker has returned to
        his home planet of Tatooine in
        an attempt to rescue his
        friend Han Solo from the
        clutches of the vile gangster
        Jabba the Hutt.

        Little does Luke know that the
        GALACTIC EMPIRE has secretly
        begun construction on a new
        armored space station even
        more powerful than the first
        dreaded Death Star.

        When completed, this ultimate
        weapon will spell certain doom
        for the small band of rebels
        struggling to restore freedom
        to the galaxy...

        title: The Phantom Menace
        episode: 1
        release_date: 1999-05-19
        opening crawl: Turmoil has engulfed the
        Galactic Republic. The taxation
        of trade routes to outlying star
        systems is in dispute.

        Hoping to resolve the matter
        with a blockade of deadly
        battleships, the greedy Trade
        Federation has stopped all
        shipping to the small planet
        of Naboo.

        While the Congress of the
        Republic endlessly debates
        this alarming chain of events,
        the Supreme Chancellor has
        secretly dispatched two Jedi
        Knights, the guardians of
        peace and justice in the
        galaxy, to settle the conflict....
